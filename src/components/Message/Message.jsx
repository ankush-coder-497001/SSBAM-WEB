      Shri Sai Baba Aadarsh Mahavidyalaya is an institution to provide quality higher education. We aim to prepare personalities who not only become successful not only in terms of economic benefits but also become successful in supporting their family, serving the society and the nation. In todays world, technology has greatly helped us to increase the levels of awareness. The policy makers are also contributing greatly in framing new education policies to make the population literate and knowledgeable. To achieve these goals, a number of new educational systems are being set up throughout the country. Parents are investing enough time and capital to get their ward admitted in good colleges in India and abroad. But before we make the decision, we need to introspect what do we want from education? Education should not be limited to only obtaining degrees. We need to think beyond the certificates. We need to focus on building citizens who are not just literate but who develop the skills to observe, to analyse, to communicate, to interpret, to make wise decisions, to be compassionate, to be honest. We need to build a platform that will help students exhibit their diverse skills from time to time. We, the Management and faculty of Shri Sai Baba Aadarsh Mahavidyalaya assure you that we are putting all our efforts in building individuals who are not just look smart, but also work smart and wise. The details of the college have been mentioned in this website. You can also connect with us through this Facebook page www.facebook.com/ssbam.co.in.
