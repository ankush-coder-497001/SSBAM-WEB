    It gives me immense pleasure to introduce Shri Sai Baba Aadarsh Mahavidhyalaya, Ambikapur, as a multidisciplinary college, in the tribal district of Surguja of Chhattisgarh state. This college was established on 15th August 2003 at Ambikapur, with an approach to create an outstanding status in the educational standard by providing the best possible higher education. Considerable investment in the college has been made over the last few years in order to meet the demands of the consistently growing student population. This includes the building of new teaching skills and upgrading of the existing areas. Our College is permanently affiliated to Sarguja University, Ambikapur, Chhattisgarh. It is also recognized by Chhattisgarh State Government and University Grants Commission Under Section 2(f). Our college is forging ahead academically in all five streams like Arts, Commerce, Science, Computer Science and Management , suited to meet contemporary needs of youth while giving acknowledgement to the imperatives of pragmatism, it ensures that knowledge never drowns in the sea of information. The college has, equally convincingly , carved a niche for itself in the realm of co-curricular activities. This is the result of an early recognition of the impertinence of a rounded, well-developed personality, guaranteed by a balanced blend of academic, cultural and sports talent. Students are encouraged to actively participate in a great number of events, organized and promoted by numerous committees. A very well endowed library and excellent laboratory facilities are additional assets. It is little wonder, that Shri Sai Baba Aadarsh Mahavidhyalaya, Ambikapur has positioned itself firmly on the map of Sarguja University and Figures on its merit lists with unfailing regularity. We assure personal attention & care and a healthy environment for the optimum development of the students. Performa nce is analyzed from time to time thorough Tests, Examination & Group Discussions. Modes of improvement are suggested & implemented with the help of dedicated and well qualified staff. A good rapport between students & teachers is encouraged for the benefit of learners. Our College is also the study centre of Mahatma Gandhi Hindi Antarrashtriya Vishwavidyalaya (A Central Government University), Wardha, Maharastra, India for various distance learning programs. The main aim or goal of our college is to become best college of Chhattisgarh.
